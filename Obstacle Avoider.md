# Obstacle-avoider-using-Arduino
A bot which can move without collisions with walls with the help of ultrasonic sensors.

First of all get all the required parts:

You can get all the material for the above using the following links:

1 x Chassis --> https://a.co/d/2pmxRiq

2 x Dc Motor --> https://a.co/d/hThEPPq

1 x L298 Motor Driver --> https://a.co/d/6bdZdHH

1 x Arduino Uno --> https://a.co/d/2X68hMl

1 x 12v rechargable battery --> https://a.co/d/3i5x2lS

1 x HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic Sensor --> https://a.co/d/3Gg9r8x

As per need x Jumper wires --> https://a.co/d/9OpCN2D

On the chassis for the bot put all components for working something like this:

After that the connections can be done as shown in the schematics below:

If your connections look something like this at first:

Don't get worried they will usually end up looking like this but if you have done everything correctly it will work for sure and you can improve the wiring while putting the components on the chassis.

Now for the coding part i will provide the code below for the functioning:


you can download the code using the given link and put it in your arduino:

Congratulations you have built your own obstacle avoider bot using arduino uno.

After attatching the battery mine was working completely fine as you can see in the video:

If you have any complications with the same you can try asking it in the queries section i will be there to help asap.
