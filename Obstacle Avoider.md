# Obstacle-avoider-using-Arduino
A bot which can move without collisions with walls with the help of ultrasonic sensors.
We need a chassis for the bot to put all components for working in our case something like this:

After that the schematic and the connections for it can be done as shown below:

If your connections look something like this:

don't get worried they usually end up looking like this but if you have done everything correctly it will work for sure.
