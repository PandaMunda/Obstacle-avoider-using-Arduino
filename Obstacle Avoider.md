# Obstacle-avoider-using-Arduino
A bot which can move without collisions with walls with the help of ultrasonic sensors.

We need a chassis for the bot to put all components for working in our case something like this:

After that the schematic and the connections for it can be done as shown below:

If your connections look something like this:

Don't get worried they will usually end up looking like this but if you have done everything correctly it will work for sure and you can improve the wiring while the assembling.

Now for the coding part i will provide the code below for the functioning:
